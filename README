PBM in postgres
===============

Potential implementation improvements
-------------------------------------
- Use dynamic shared memory (dsa.h) for the PBM data structures?
- Ordered index scans (B-Trees): should have special handling for when the index order is correlated with physical order - can treat it similar to a sequential scan (but need to re-implement still...)
- ...

Known bugs
----------
- For pbm_part1: it is technically possible for 2 workers to try to load the same buffer at the same time, both allocate *from the free list*, and one of them leaks the free list buffer when it sees someone else loaded the block it wanted. For clock or sampling, the invalid buffer will eventually get found again, but for PBM1 we won't have a reference to it and it is lost.
- If a query is cancelled (fails, etc.) the PBM unregister functions may not be called because the End*Scan methods are not called...
- Sequential scans currently don't handle backwards scans properly
- Trailing index scans: should only be considered if the index sorts the output (e.g. btrees)
- ...


PostgreSQL Database Management System
=====================================

This directory contains the source code distribution of the PostgreSQL
database management system.

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
that supports an extended subset of the SQL standard, including
transactions, foreign keys, subqueries, triggers, user-defined types
and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.

PostgreSQL has many language interfaces, many of which are listed here:

See the file INSTALL for instructions on how to build and install
PostgreSQL.  That file also lists supported operating systems and
hardware platforms and contains information regarding any other
software packages that are required to build or run the PostgreSQL
system.  Copyright and license information can be found in the
file COPYRIGHT.  A comprehensive documentation set is included in this
distribution; it can be read as described in the installation
instructions.

The latest version of this software may be obtained at
https://www.postgresql.org/download/.  For more information look at our
web site located at https://www.postgresql.org/.
